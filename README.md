## Usage

The current FirmRec release is meant to be used with [docker](https://www.docker.com). So firstly, you need to build firmrec docker with following steps:

1. Build the base docker image with `docker build -f Dockerfile-base -t firmrec-base .`. This command build up all dependencies and input entry identification module.
2. Build working docker image with `make build`, which just copies firmrec source code into a new docker images. When FirmRec code or `config.yaml` is modified, this command should be executed to update the docker image.

Then, prepare inputs for firmrec. The docker container uses `inout` directory as a data directory to read inputs from and store outputs into. We've prepared a sample archive of inout. You can download [this archive]() and extract it to the project root.

Here are things that have been prepared in inout directory for running FirmRec:

1. Known vulnerability information at `inout/vuln_info`
2. Target firmware images at `inout/firmware/images`
3. Task list specified by `inout/experiment.json`

To use LLM for input entry searching during vulnerability detection, it is required to configure `llm_key`, `llm_url`, and `llm_model` fields in `config.yaml`.

After input preparation, you can run FirmRec with previously built docker image with the following steps:

1. Spawn a docker shell by executing `make start` under project root directory.
2. Execute `python -m firmrec.pipeline all` in the docker shell. This command will automatically finish all FirmRec steps and show vulnerability detection results. More details of `firmrec.pipeline` are presented in [firmrec/pipeline/README.md](firmrec/pipeline/README.md).
